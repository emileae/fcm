“AS LEADERS, WOMEN RULE: New studies find that female managers outshine their
male counterparts in almost every measure” - Special Report, Business Week



We live and operate in a ‘high trust’ selling environment.
We are also living in a business era that I call the ‘relational
marketing’ era. This “relationship stuff” comes naturally to
women (it’s in their genes), but it is painfully difficult for many men.

Old school selling is dead! Endless boozy lunches are a thing of the past
and so-called golf course negotiations are history. This is a time when deals
are struck on high trust and powerful relationships. Women have a natural
aptitude for good communication, natural empathy and softer aggression.
These are all powerful characteristics that benefit the new age negotiator.

“ Be smart! Make sure that women dominate your negotiating
teams and processes. Even better, ensure that you have a strong
representation of women at top management and board level. ”

“ The ‘Connection Proclivity’ in women starts early. When asked,
‘How was school today?’ a girl usually tells her mother every detail
of what happened, while a boy might grunt, ‘Fine.’ ”
