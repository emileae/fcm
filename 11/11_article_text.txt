To recap, last month I introduced the concept of a payback period
which is important to understand when considering spending
money on hot water technology. A payback will enable you to
understand the potential for saving and how long the money you spend
(the cost) will take to be repaid by the saving made.

We started to look at low cost technology covering efficient shower
heads. Have you checked your shower heads to see if they are efficient?
If they are inefficient, have you bought an efficient fitting yet?

Every month you delay the decision will cost you. I will now continue to
address the next of low cost interventions – insulation.

THE USE OF INSULATION
Insulation is one of the unsung heroes of the energy efficiency world that
is often neglected when looking at methods to save energy. This is a low
cost way to limit the loss or gain of heat or cold, which means savings
on energy. Areas where insulation proves effective are keeping heat in
(hot water or your house) or keeping the cold in (your fridge or house);
or visa versa.


Research shows that insulation is still one of the better “business value”
initiatives that can be implemented by a business to drive out energy
savings. What do I mean by “business value”? – essentially value achieved
by a business in implementing an intervention versus its related cost.
The same is true for your home and specifically relating to your hot
water. So what should you do?

There are two ways to insulate for hot water. The first is to insulate your
geyser and the second is to insulate (or clad) the hot water pipes leading
from your geyser to your taps.

GEYSER INSULATION
Geyser insulation, often commonly referred to as a “geyser blanket”, can
help reduce the electricity a geyser uses. Insulation helps retard the rate at
which a geyser cools when switched off and helps reduce the heat loss to
the atmosphere while hot water is being stored. Less electricity is required
to keep the water hot at the pre-set thermostat temperature or reheat the
water after the geyser has been switched off (e.g. when using a timer).
Tests have shown that up 20% of the electricity used to heat water can
be saved by insulating the geyser.

Cost : R700 (plus installation – this can typically be done as a DIY job)
Saving : R1000 per year (R83 per month)*
Payback : less than 1 year*

*Based on tests done on a 150l geyser switched off for 24 hours and
then reheated.

PIPE INSULATION
Insulating the pipes is a similar process to wrapping the geyser in blanket
but typically saves less. This is because a smaller volume of hot water
in the hot water pipes is kept warm. Pipes are wrapped in insulated
cladding material similar to how you would wrap a limb in a bandage.
This is can be difficult to install as pipe work may be difficult to access.
Cost: R300 (excluding installation – this can typically be done as a DIY
job).

Saving: Exact savings unknown*
Payback: Estimated to be just over a year*
*Has not been formally tested by any recognised organisation.
Next month we will take a look at geyser timers or controllers as the final
low cost intervention for hot water.
