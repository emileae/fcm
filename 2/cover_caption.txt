Among the features of tropical
reefs are the Clownfish which
inhabit and protect anemones. They
are better known as Nemoes since
the advent of the animated film,
Finding Nemo.
These courageous little fish don’t
hesitate to attack any creature which
comes too close to their anemone,
and despite their size (less than
20cm), can deliver an impressive bite.
The largest fish in any anemone is a
female, which dominates males and
other smaller fish in the colony by
emitting pheromones.
When the dominant female dies, the
largest male changes sex and the
anemone’s life continues.
