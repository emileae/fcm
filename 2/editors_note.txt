Editor’s Note
As you bask in the warmth of this glorious
summer, FCM in hand, perhaps bobbing on
some inflated animal in the pool, close your
eyes, breathe deeply, slowly, and remember the
women in your life, past and present; remember
the women in your world, their dreams
and aspirations; remember the women who
relentlessly work towards making a difference,
and remember the girl who once had that
potential…before the abuse…she too had a
place before this.

-Meryl
