“I swear I didn’t put
her up to it.”

*** article content ***

It’s not often that I come out on top. TLJ says
that I am unlikely to ever come out on top if I
don’t make the effort to get off the couch at the
bottom first. That may well be true but it does
sound terribly exhausting and I am sure that if I
wait long enough someone will figure out a way
to get me and the couch to the top.

Well, as much as I like to win but really can’t
be bothered to try, TLJ is the exact opposite
and is okay with not winning but feels there is
real merit in trying. I know, I have no idea where
she gets most of her philosophies from but I find
some of them quite disturbing. Mostly the ones
that involve me doing any form of manual labour.
Anyhow, TLJ saw an opportunity for the family
to be together and to be a part of a snowman
building competition out at the Grand West
Casino ice rink.

I am not a huge fan of the casino, simply
because TLJ and I once went out there for an
evening when the casino opened and casinos
were new in South Africa, to see what all the
fuss was about. We agreed to spend no more
than R100 each and to have some fun. My R100
went into a one-armed bandit – presumably
called that because all they do is steal your
money – and was gone in under 60 seconds.
TLJ, on the other hand, went to the food court
and had a lovely meal.

Returning to the scene of the crime, we arrived
at the casino ice rink, paid our entry fee and
together with the 20 or so other entrants, were
told we had one hour to build our snowman. As
soon as the countdown timer started, TLJ and
the Moose dived into the project and started
building furiously. Mackers immediately got
bored and demanded a cooldrink while Sizzles
busied herself by stealing snow from the piles of
snow belonging to other competitors.

It was quite amazing to watch actually. Snow
(more like crushed ice) was in high demand as
it had been deposited in small piles on the ice
rink with each family having a designated pile of
snow. Here in the midst of this highly-charged
and competitive atmosphere was this twoyear-
old tottering around with her bucket (being
encouraged by her mother mind you) nicking
snow right out from underneath peoples noses,
and taking it back to the Moose and TLJ.I didn’t
know whether to hug her or turn her in.

Frankly, after watching for three minutes, the
whole thing seemed like too much effort and so
partly in order to avoid Sizzles being arrested
and ‘Team Clark’ being disqualified, and partly
to find something to do, Mackers, Sizzles and
I trooped off the ice to go and explore the food
court and the casino.

By the time we arrived back an hour later,
we had - between us spilled an entire can of
Grapetiser on the already slippery casino floor,
been ejected from the gambling floor, gotten lost
in some kind of weird restaurant town and been
frisked by security twice. When we got back to
the ice rink, our (I use the term ”our” very loosely)
snowman was magnificent.

The Moose and TLJ had, thanks to Sizzles’
thievery, managed to build the biggest snowman
by far. How no one was suspicious is beyond
me and clearly the field of competitors was
not comprised of the shiniest spoons in the
dishwasher.

Not only was the snowman twice the size of
everyone else’s but it was also bedecked in all
sorts of princess-like garb including a crown, dark
glasses, ear rings, a necklace and a Paris Hilton
type dog! I’m not sure where all this stuff came
from but I can vouch for Sizzles – she was with
me getting thrown out of the gambling area at the
time that these items must have been liberated.

While we were waiting to go; Sizzles,
Mackers and I busied ourselves by scooting
around illegally on the ice rink in our shoes. As
we scooted I happened to overhear one mom
saying that our snowman was sure to be the
winner. Never one to miss out on an opportunity
for glory I steered Mackers and Sizzles quickly
back to our snowman before judging started.

It was initially nail-biting stuff as I hadn’t
bothered to look at the competition but I
was pretty sure we were in with a good shot,
especially when Sizzles came past eating a
carrot while another little girl in the distance was
crying that her snowman’s nose was ”lost”. I
swear I didn’t put her up to it.

As fate would have it all our hard work was
rewarded and we, the Clark Family, were
declared the winners. We won a Wimpy voucher,
an ice skating voucher and some nifty Grand
West Casino water bottles which I will be proud
to send my girls to school with. We also got our
photo taken with some radio DJ dude. I don’t
know who he was because they introduced him
before we got back.

I know technically that all the credit should go
to the Moose and TLJ, but we are a family, which
means we stand together. We win together and
we lose together. We mostly lose together. But
for one bright moment we were the stars and
everyone was envying us and our R150 Wimpy
Voucher! I suspect there is a lesson in here
somewhere but it probably backs up one of
TLJ’s weird philosophies. Maybe I will have a sit
down on the couch and think about it.
