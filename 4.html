            River and wetland ecosystems are
            amongst the most threatened, yet
            most valuable systems worldwide.
            Habitat degradation through increasing
            urbanisation and water pollution are two of
            the largest threats to these systems, and to
            the animals dependent on them for survival.
            Of particular concern in urban areas is
            sewage, and the dumping or run off of waste
            into water ways. Sewage effluent contains
            industrial waste, municipal wastes, domestic
            waste, animal remains and faecal matter, all
            containing a variety of harmful substances.
            Toxic chemicals are known to enter the food
            chain and accumulate in the tissues of top
            predators, leading to infertility, poor health and
            vulnerability to disease. Throughout the world,
            otters and other aquatic top predators have
            suffered population declines and even local
            extinctions due to exposure and subsequent
            bioaccumulation of toxic pollutants.

            The Cape Clawless Otter (Aonyx capensis)
            occupies the role of top predator in the Western
            Cape's aquatic systems and is a potentially
            important umbrella species for freshwater
            ecosystems. Listed as ‘Least Concern' on
            IUCN's Red List, it may also serve as an
            important flagship species and bio-indicator of
            water pollution throughout the Western Cape
            and South Africa. Within the Western Cape,
            the Cape Peninsula provides a microcosm of
            the current threats to otter survival with both
            urban and agricultural land transformation
            altering their natural habitat and both chronic
            and acute pollution events threatening their
            health. Presently there is no data on the
            biology, distribution and conservation status of
            otters in the Cape Peninsula and thus there
            is no baseline data upon which to assess the
            combined effects of habitat loss and pollution
            of aquatic ecosystems on the distribution,
            abundance and health of otters.

            It is for this reason that UCT began a
            PhD project to study the otters in the Cape
            Peninsula. Their reliance on fresh water in an
            urban environment like the South Peninsula
            does put them at risk to exposure to pollutants
            and the loss of suitable habitat. In addition,
            the fact that they're most active at dawn and
            dusk makes them difficult to monitor, and so
            any change in population size might not be
            noted until it is too late. Still in its early stages,
            the project aims to understand the spatial
            ecology of otters living in the Peninsula: how
            they use the urban space as opposed to
            the more natural, pristine areas; and, most
            importantly, to gain insight into how they are
            coping with the pollution loads in the urban
            rivers. Ultimately, by understanding the needs
            of an aquatic top predator, the project hopes
            to provide management recommendations
            for the conservation and sustainable use of
            the Peninsula's rivers and wetlands, which in
            turn will benefit all species dependent on these
            systems for their survival.

        <p>
            As part of the data collection, we are asking
            for all sightings of otters to be reported to the
            Peninsula Otter Watch who coordinates otter
            sightings to monitor the presence of otters in
            the Cape. Please contact Nicola Okes with
            details of any otter sightings, injuries or deaths.
            If possible, indicate: location, time, unusual
            behaviour or markings/injuries, what the otter
            was doing, and any other information you
            may have. Photographs and GPS positions
            of sightings are most welcome. Further
            information can be found and sightings can be
            submitted online at www.nicolaokes.co.za

        <div class="title_s">HABITAT</div>
        <p>
            African clawless otters can be found anywhere from open coastal
            plains, to semiarid regions, to densely forested areas. Surviving mostly in
            southern Africa, the otters live in areas surrounding permanent bodies of
            water, usually surrounded by some form of foliage. Logs, branches, and
            loose foliage greatly appeal to the otter as this provides shelter, shade
            and great rolling opportunities. Slow and rather clumsy on land, they build
            burrows in banks near water, allowing for easier food access and a quick
            escape from predators. In the False Bay area of the Cape Peninsula they
            have been observed scavenging along beaches and rocks and hunting
            in shallow surf for mullet. They are mainly nocturnal in urban areas and lie
            up during the day in quiet bushy areas.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title_s">REPRODUCTION</div>
        <p>
            Females give birth to litters containing two to five young around early
            spring. Mating takes place in short periods throughout the rainy season
            in December. Afterwards, both males and females go their separate ways
            and return to their solitary lives once more. Young are raised solely by the
            females. Gestation lasts around two months (63 days). Weaning takes
            place between 45 and 60 days, with the young reaching full maturity
            around one year of age.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title_s">DIET</div>
        <p>
            The diet of Aonyx capensis primarily includes water-dwelling animals,
            such as crabs, fish, frogs, and worms. They dive after prey to catch
            it, then swim to shore again, where they eat. Their fore paws come in
            handy as searching devices and are great tools for digging on the muddy
            bottoms of ponds and rivers, picking up rocks and looking under logs.
            Extremely sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) are used as sensors in the water
            to pick up the movements of potential prey.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title_s">BEHAVIOR</div>
        <p>
            Though mostly solitary animals, African clawless otters will live in
            neighboring territories of family groups of up to five individuals with
            each still having its own range within that territory. They mostly keep to
            themselves, unless seeking a mate. Territories are marked using a pair of
            anal glands which secrete a particular scent. Each otter is very territorial
            over its particular range.
            Awkward on land but acrobats in the water, these animals spend their days
            swimming and catching food. They return to underground burrows (holts)
            for safety, cooling or a rubdown using grasses and leaves. Mainly aquatic
            creatures, their tails are used for locomotion and propel them through the
            water. They are also used for balance when walking or sitting upright.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title_s">PREDATION</div>
        <p>
            Quick in the water and burrowing on land, A. capensis does not have
            many predators. Its greatest threat comes from the python, which will
            often lay in wait near or in the water. Other predators would include the
            crocodile and fish eagles. If threatened, a high-pitched scream is emitted
            to warn neighboring otters and confuse a predator.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title_s">THERMOREGULATION</div>
        <p>
            Living in Africa, environments can become very hot. Staying cool means
            spending time in the water, and also using burrows as a way to escape
            the highest temperatures of the day. To stay warm, on the other hand, the
            otters depend solely on their thick fur. Guard hairs cover the body, acting
            as insulation. Since the otter lacks an insulating layer of body fat, its only
            means of warmth is provided by its thick coat of fur.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title_s">ECONOMIC IMPACT</div>
        <p>
            The biggest threat to African clawless otters comes from humans. Aonyx
            specimens will often forage in man-made fisheries and may be hunted or
            become entangled in nets. Overfishing by humans may reduce the food
            supply available to otters. They are sometimes hunted for their thick, soft
            pelts, which humans use in forms of clothing. In forested areas, logging
            may be a major threat since erosion leads to greatly increased turbidity in
            rivers which can in turn greatly reduce the populations of fish on which the
            otters depend. This may well be a far greater threat to otters than hunting.
