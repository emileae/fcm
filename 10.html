            "AS LEADERS, WOMEN RULE: New studies find that female managers outshine their

            We live and operate in a 'high trust' selling environment.
            We are also living in a business era that I call the 'relational
            marketing' era. This "relationship stuff" comes naturally to
            women (it's in their genes), but it is painfully difficult for many men.

                    " The 'Connection Proclivity' in women starts early. When asked,
                    'How was school today?' a girl usually tells her mother every detail
                    of what happened, while a boy might grunt, 'Fine.' "

            Old school selling is dead! Endless boozy lunches are a thing of the past
            and so-called golf course negotiations are history. This is a time when deals
            are struck on high trust and powerful relationships. Women have a natural
            aptitude for good communication, natural empathy and softer aggression.
            These are all powerful characteristics that benefit the new age negotiator.

            " Be smart! Make sure that women dominate your negotiating
            teams and processes. Even better, ensure that you have a strong
            representation of women at top management and board level. "
