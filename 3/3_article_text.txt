For those who know me, they can verify
that I do not like crowds. And I certainly
do not care to share my shower and
toilet with 2 500 revellers! So it was with some
trepidation that my colleague, Richard, and I
headed off to Swellendam to cover the Up the
Creek Festival on the Breede River.
We thought that if we arrived early on Friday
morning we would have the pick of the
camping area, under a shady tree, to protect
us from the blistering heat. To our dismay, we
were met by a sea of tents with not even a
tiny bit of shade available. So we opted for
convenience and chose a spot right next to
the ablution block. Note to self: arrive early on
Thursday next time!

After setting up our tent we headed to the
river to cool off. The temperature by this stage
was well into the 30s. Already the river was filled
with all sorts of floating paraphernalia, either
bobbing next to the stage or parked under a
massive awning that had been constructed in
the middle of the river. On the paraphernalia
were friendly and considerate people of all
shapes and sizes, some with their children, just
letting their hair down, escaping from reality for
4 days and having a ball. Heee ha!
As the day progressed we discovered that
in fact we had not chosen such a bad spot
for our campsite after all. Being right next to
the outdoor showers meant that it provided
us with instant relief, however brief, from the
now unbearable 40 degrees. The other added
benefit, and I know I am going to sound like a bit
of a pervert, (but it was mainly due to Richard’s
encouragement), was the continual stream of

lovely ladies taking lengthy showers to cool off.
We had many a male offering us money for our
space. With my strong entrepreneurial spirit, I
must admit, I was tempted.

As the sun descended behind the hills,
the party began to change gear. The sheer
energy of the music took me somewhat by
surprise. I sort of expected a more chilled out
vibe. Looking around me however, I noticed
that there were far younger people around,
compared to myself, which would explain why
I didn’t recognise any of the music. Although
not all the music appealed to me, I was not
to be outshone by the younger crowd and
soon got into the spirit of things. What I did
appreciate most about the bands was their
raw energy, the rapport they created with the
crowd, and the obvious talent they possessed.
It was quite an eye opener and put my support
firmly back in SA music. My favourites were
December Streets, Jeremy Loops, Desmond
and the Tutus, and The Nomadic Orchestra
(which is a five-piece instrumental band that
got one’s foot a tapping). Although I did not get
to listen to all the bands, one thing is certain -
for the 500 bucks one pays for the four days
and three nights of pure entertainment by over
thirty of SA’s top musicians, is a pure give away.
So, to the organisers, a resounding WELL
DONE for getting all these artists together, and
credos on the sound quality, too. Absolutely
first class!

Just when I thought I had had as much fun
as I could, it was time for the Anything That
Floats competition. This was a celebration of
the creative spirit. Anything and everything that
could float, and even some that couldn’t, took
part in this awesome competition. The winners
of The Best Float, The Float with the Mostest,
and The Most Romantic Float were treated to
an array of prizes to reward their grand efforts.
As for the rest of the festival, I overheard
a fellow reveller put it in a nutshell when
saying she felt quite exhausted by the
continual entertainment and was completely
overstimulated by the kaleidoscope of colour,
music, people and activities. The glow on her
face indicated it was a pleasant weariness.

Thumbs up to Reliance (reliance.co.za),
and Greenpop (greenpop.org), who partnered
in greening the festival by calculating and
offsetting their carbon footprint, as well as
implementing various recycling activities. A
local company, Bontebok Recycling, worked
tirelessly at all sorts of hours, managing the
collection, separation and removal of waste.
Trashback (trashback.org) also had an
innovative program that rewarded people for
rubbish that was brought in.

Would I go there again? Absolutely! Would I
camp in the same eye candy spot? No! I would
find a more peaceful spot (if that’s possible)
on the outer regions of the camping ground.
I would also not bother to bring my own food
as the food stalls are of a high standard, wellpriced
and cater to all culinary needs. Less
stuff to pack, too. Any extra space needs to be
dedicated to ice. And beers.

If I could offer any caution, it would be that
parents should be aware that their children will
be exposed to some rather hectic language by
some of the bands and the MCs. That’s just
me…older, and all that!

In a quieter moment, (not sure when that
was!), I wondered where it had all began.

On returning home I logged on and went
to upthecreek.co.za and found that it was
inspired and created by Annie Sowden who
says in her blog, “A LIFE magazine, a 40th
birthday party and a riverside camp called Up
the Creek. That’s how it all started.” She had
read an article on the 1969 Woodstock festival
in a LIFE magazine and when asked what the
highlight of the festival was, one reveller simply
replied, “Jimi Hendrix at dawn.” This was the
inspiration she needed to organise a friend’s
40th birthday party at Up the Creek camp.
With three bands playing on the stoep of the
farmhouse, “I got my Jimi Hendrix-at-dawn
moment,” says Annie. “Four months later, in
January 1991, Up the Creek Festival debuted
with 150 paying punters. 22 Years on…and Up
the Creek is still one long weekend of rock ‘n
roll revelry.”

22 Years! Well that explains how well
organised the event is. Many years’ experience!
It also explains all the guys I saw who were
older, die-hard looking types. Older than me,
I might add. They’re addicted and who can
blame them?
